## [1.3.26.0] — OAuth scaffolding (DB + crypto + registry contract) (2026-04-27)

The seven Settings → Integrations / Import-Modal providers (Slack, Notion, GitHub, Linear, Trello, Asana, Jira) have stayed as honest empty states since v1.0 because each requires a developer-portal app registration with credentials only the human owner can produce. This release ships the infrastructure — `oauth_connections` table with AES-256-GCM-encrypted tokens, RLS service-role-only writes, partial index on `expires_at` for the refresh worker, `lib/oauth/crypto.ts` with random-IV-per-call sealing and tamper-detection on decrypt, `lib/oauth/registry.ts` with the `OAuthProviderConfig` adapter contract + `isProviderConfigured` env-var check + `KNOWN_PROVIDER_IDS` reserving the URL space for all seven. Registry ships empty: each provider adapter is a separate per-Mastery-cycle PR landing when credentials are available. **231/231** tests passing across 30 files (208 → 231; 23 new across `oauth-crypto.test.ts` + `oauth-registry.test.ts`).

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13260---2026-04-27).

## [1.3.25.0] — Sessions tab labels the current device (2026-04-27)

The Profile → Sessions tab has shown nothing more than `Signed in {timestamp}` since v1.0. New `lib/utils/user-agent.ts` parses the request UA server-side (no new deps; declined the 27kB `ua-parser-js` for a 60-line implementation) into `{ browser, os, device }`, and the Sessions card now renders a label like `"Chrome on macOS · Desktop"` plus an `Active` badge. Edge is matched before Chrome (Edge UAs include the Chrome token); iPad is classified Tablet even though iPadOS 13+ advertises as Mac. 11 new tests; per-device session list still not shipping — Supabase Auth doesn't expose it without the admin API, and the dashed empty-state below the card still says so. **208/208** tests passing across 28 files (197 → 208).

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13250---2026-04-27).

## [1.3.24.0] — Two real blog posts close the "blog ships with one post" gap (2026-04-27)

`/blog` had been a single-post listing since v1.0 with a `More posts on the way` placeholder. Wrote two posts grounded in real code that exists in the repo: `how-decision-dna-scoring-works` walks the four-dimension scoring pipeline in `lib/ai/decision-scorer.ts` — Groq → Together → heuristic fallback, the `extractJson` step for Llama-wrapping-JSON-in-fences, stamped `model_version` on every score, and the two alerts (heuristic-rate, p95 duration) we run on the call log; `workspace-maturity-score` documents `lib/wms.ts` end-to-end — the five WMS events with their real weights, the four-layer threshold map (0/15/35/60), the soft-sidebar vs hard-API gate, and the Power-user override toggle. `/blog` listing + `[slug]` route + `sitemap.ts` all updated together. **197/197** tests passing, type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13240---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.23.9] — Canonical URLs on every public marketing page (2026-04-27)

Without `alternates.canonical`, query-string variants like `/contact?topic=enterprise` split SEO authority. Added canonical URLs and `openGraph.url` to all 11 public marketing pages (`/pricing`, `/about`, `/features`, `/comparison`, `/changelog`, `/blog`, `/contact`, `/careers`, `/docs`, `/privacy`, `/terms`). Combined with the v1.3.23.8 sitemap coverage, the marketing surface is now SEO-complete. **197/197** tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13239---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.23.8] — Sitemap covers all public routes + blog posts (2026-04-27)

`app/sitemap.ts` listed 7 routes; five real public pages were missing (`/contact`, `/careers`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/docs`) and the single published blog post wasn't indexed individually. Added all five plus a `blogPosts` array emitting per-post entries with real publish dates. New `HIGH_PRIORITY` lookup keeps homepage at 1, `/pricing` at 0.9, `/features` at 0.8, everything else at 0.7. Comments document the additive contract for future posts. **197/197** tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13238---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.23.7] — BillingClient Enterprise card emits paywall.contact.clicked (2026-04-27)

The global UpgradeModal already fired `paywall.contact.clicked` before routing to `/contact?topic=enterprise`, but BillingClient's Enterprise card did not. Funnel queries undercounted Enterprise interest from the in-app surface. Now both surfaces emit the same event with `plan` + `surface: 'billing-page'`. Closes the parity gap from the last three ships (`paywall.gate.shown`, `paywall.checkout.errored`, `paywall.checkout.succeeded`). **197/197** tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13237---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.23.6] — Marketing /pricing Enterprise CTA passes ?topic=enterprise (2026-04-27)

v1.3.23.2 made `/contact` topic-aware. The in-app billing page Enterprise card already passed `?topic=enterprise`, but the marketing `/pricing` Enterprise card — the larger Enterprise traffic source — still routed to bare `/contact`. Now both surfaces hit the same `TOPICS.enterprise` registry entry, surfacing the tailored banner with pre-filled mailto subject + body. **197/197** tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13236---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.23.5] — Marketing /pricing page reads PLAN_PRICING_USD constants (2026-04-27)

The landing PricingSection already imported the constants and BillingClient was synced in v1.3.23.0, but the marketing `/pricing` route hardcoded `'19'/'15'/'30'/'24'` strings — the exact drift pattern that caused the $9/$19/$49 mismatch in v1.3.23.0. Now derives `monthlyPrice` / `annualPrice` from `PLAN_PRICING_USD` and `PLAN_PRICING_USD_ANNUAL` so a single edit in `lib/utils/constants.ts` propagates to every price surface. **197/197** tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13235---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.23.4] — Funnel coverage for full-upgrade modal entry points (2026-04-27)

Five gated surfaces emit `paywall.gate.shown` before opening the modal, but the three generic "Upgrade" / "Change plan" buttons surfacing the `full-upgrade` variant did not. Wired three call sites: settings billing tab Free → Upgrade button, settings billing tab paid → Change plan button, in-app billing page top-right "Change Plan" button. Each emits `paywall.gate.shown` with `variant: 'full-upgrade'`, `plan`, and a distinct `surface` label so funnel queries can split per entry point. **197/197** tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13234---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.23.3] — Billing-page funnel telemetry parity (2026-04-27)

v1.3.23.1 wired the in-app billing page's Upgrade buttons but only emitted `paywall.checkout.clicked`. Now `paywall.checkout.errored` (with `status` + `message`) and `paywall.checkout.succeeded` (with `plan` + `interval`) also fire — same shape as the global UpgradeModal — with `surface: 'billing-page'` so funnel queries can split clicks vs successful redirects vs errors. **197/197** tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13233---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.23.2] — Contact page is topic-aware (2026-04-27)

v1.3.23.1's billing page Enterprise card routes to `/contact?topic=enterprise`, but the contact page wasn't reading `?topic`. Now it does: when `topic=enterprise`, an indigo Enterprise banner renders above the standard contact rows with a primary mailto button pre-filled with subject + body template (team size, current tools, must-haves, timeline). `TOPICS` registry is a single object — future topics (security, migration, etc.) are one-line additions. **197/197** tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13232---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.23.1] — Hotfix: Billing page Upgrade buttons wired (2026-04-27)

v1.3.23.0 corrected every dollar value but left the buttons broken: top-right "Change Plan" linked to a 404 (`/workspace/[slug]/upgrade`), per-card "Upgrade" buttons had no `onClick`. Both wired: "Change Plan" now triggers `useUpgradeModal.show('full-upgrade')`; per-card Starter/Pro buttons POST to `/api/v1/billing/checkout` and redirect to Gumroad; Enterprise card routes to `/contact?topic=enterprise`. Pending spinner, in-flight disable, inline amber error alert, `paywall.checkout.clicked` telemetry with `surface: 'billing-page'`. **197/197** tests passing, type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13231---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.23.0] — In-app billing page synced to PLAN_LIMITS + PLAN_PRICING_USD (2026-04-27)

Audit found `BillingClient.tsx` had drifted hard from the constants: Team card said `$9` (real: `$19`), Business card said `$19` (real: `$30`), Enterprise showed a fake `$49/seat/month` (real: contact-sales), Free card listed 4 of 6 limits, Decisions usage row hardcoded `limit: -1` so Free workspaces never saw their `12/20` cap progress. Fixed by deriving prices from `PLAN_PRICING_USD` and limits from `PLAN_LIMITS`; `null` (the contact-sales sentinel) renders as **Custom** and skips annual-discount math. Single source of truth now extends to the in-app billing screen the same way it does to the marketing pricing page. **197/197** tests passing, type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13230---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.22.1] — Hotfix: extend daily AI quota to generate + analyze (2026-04-27)

v1.3.22.0 closed the daily-quota loophole on `/api/v1/ai/chat` but explicitly deferred `/api/v1/ai/generate` and `/api/v1/ai/analyze`. Left as-is they'd be a future quota-bypass surface the moment any UI started calling them. Both now follow the same shape: optional `workspaceId`, plan-gate via `checkAiQuota` when present, `402 PLAN_LIMIT_REACHED variant=ai-limit` on cap, `recordAiUsage` after success. **197/197** tests passing, type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13221---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.22.0] — Server-side AI daily quota (2026-04-27)

Lazynext has advertised "20 LazyMind AI queries/day" on Free / 100 on Starter / 500 on Pro / unlimited on Business since v1.0. Actual enforcement until today: a 20-req/minute burst cap plus a client-side counter that reset on page reload — so a Free user could send 20, refresh, send 20 more, indefinitely (≈28,800/day). New `ai_usage(user_id, workspace_id, day, count)` table with composite PK + RLS-locked service-role writes. New `lib/data/ai-usage.ts` (`getDailyAiUsage`, `getWorkspacePlan`, `checkAiQuota`, `recordAiUsage`; UTC day boundary; best-effort writes). New `GET /api/v1/ai/usage` endpoint hydrates the panel-header badge across reloads. `POST /api/v1/ai/chat` now accepts optional `workspaceId`, verifies membership, plan-gates against `PLAN_LIMITS[plan].aiQueries`, returns `402 PLAN_LIMIT_REACHED variant=ai-limit` when blocked, calls `recordAiUsage` after a successful response. `LazyMindPanel` sends `workspaceId` on every request, hydrates `aiCount` from the server, handles 402 by syncing the badge to the authoritative `used` and surfacing the `ai-limit` upgrade modal. **197/197** tests passing across 27 files (189 → 197; 8 new assertions in `tests/unit/ai-usage.test.ts`). Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13220---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.21.0] — Real "Create workspace" + workspace-cap enforcement (2026-04-27)

The "Create workspace" link in the `WorkspaceSelector` dropdown has, since v1.3.4.5, routed to `/onboarding` — which had two paths in `/api/v1/onboarding/workspace`: Path A *renamed* the user's existing workspace, Path B (backfill) only ran with zero memberships. So clicking "Create workspace" with an existing workspace silently renamed it. There was no real way to create a second workspace from the UI. This release ships the missing path + enforces the Free `workspaces: 1` cap added to PLAN_LIMITS in v1.3.20.0. New `POST /api/v1/workspaces` creates an additional workspace + admin membership, plan-gated by `canCreateWorkspace` against the caller's admin/owner memberships (paid-workspace owners bypass the cap). Returns `402 PLAN_LIMIT_REACHED` with `variant: 'workspace-limit'` when blocked, `409 SLUG_TAKEN` on collision. UI: new inline `CreateWorkspaceDialog` modal in `WorkspaceSelector` (auto-slugify, focus-trap, Esc dismissal); on 402 triggers the `workspace-limit` upgrade modal with a `paywall.gate.shown` telemetry event. **189/189** tests passing across 26 files (187 → 189). Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13210---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.20.0] — Pricing alignment + decision-limit enforcement (2026-04-27)

Audit of every pricing surface against `PLAN_LIMITS` turned up six inconsistencies — the marketing site advertised `"10 AI queries/day"` and `"Unlimited nodes"` on Free while the code enforced 20 queries and 100 nodes (product more generous than the copy claimed, but the inconsistency itself broke trust). Worse: the `decisions` cap on Free was advertised as 20 in three places but never actually enforced — you could log a thousand decisions on Free. Fixed all of it. `PLAN_LIMITS` extended with `decisions` (Free: 20) and `workspaces` (Free: 1) fields; pricing page Free tier corrected to `100 nodes` / `20 AI queries/day` / `5 workflows`; FAQ + comparison table aligned; new `canCreateDecision` and `canCreateWorkspace` gates; `POST /api/v1/decisions` now enforces the 20-decision cap with a `402 PLAN_LIMIT_REACHED` response that the Log Decision modal turns into the upgrade-modal `decision-limit` variant. **187/187** tests passing across 26 files (12 new assertions guard the limit shape + every gate's boundary). Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13200---2026-04-27).

## [1.3.19.0] — Production crawler + auth title fix (2026-04-27)

Wrote a Playwright crawler (`tests/e2e/prod-crawl.spec.ts`) that walks 14 public routes on `https://lazynext.com`, captures console errors, failed requests, broken images, missing alts, duplicate ids, and missing h1s, and writes a structured `test-results/crawl-report.json`. Result on the live site: 14/14 status 200, 0 console errors, 0 failed requests, 0 broken images, 0 duplicate ids, all pages have h1, avg load ~2.8s. The one real issue it surfaced: `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` both rendered the generic `Auth — Lazynext` title because the leaf pages are client components and can't export metadata. Fix: added per-segment server `layout.tsx` files with `title.absolute`, so `/sign-in` is now `Sign in — Lazynext` and `/sign-up` is `Create your account — Lazynext`. **175/175** tests passing across 25 files. Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13190---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.18.1] — Sidebar active-overlap hotfix (2026-04-27)

Sidebar lit up two nav items at once on `/decisions/outcomes`. Active matching used `pathname.startsWith(href)`, so both `/workspace/x/decisions` and `/workspace/x/decisions/outcomes` claimed active styling. Fix: pick the longest matching href and only it wins; require trailing slash to prevent prefix bleed (`/decisions-archive` would have falsely activated `/decisions`). **175/175** tests passing across 25 files. Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13181---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.18.0] — ConfirmModal + batch-positions tests (2026-04-27)

Replaces the workflow-delete `window.confirm` with a reusable, branded `ConfirmModal` (Esc-close, backdrop-cancel, autofocused confirm, `variant: 'danger'` painting in rose-600). The delete fetch now lives behind the modal's confirm handler, so the spinner shows while the DELETE request is in flight. Also adds 7 unit tests for the v1.3.15.0 batch positions zod schema — single update, empty array, non-UUID, non-integer, oversized (>200), 200-entry boundary, missing field. **175/175** tests passing across 25 files (was 168/24). Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13180---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.17.1] — Tour overlap hotfix (2026-04-27)

Onboarding tour step 7 (LazyMind) was spotlighting the wrong button and overlapping the sidebar. The selector `button[aria-label="Open LazyMind AI assistant"]` matched the bottom-of-sidebar LazyMind button — the first occurrence in DOM order — instead of the prominent top-bar CTA. Spotlight landed bottom-left, then `placement: 'left'` tried to render the tooltip further left, got viewport-clamped, and blanketed the sidebar. Step 8 (Command Palette) was also broken: it targeted an aria-label nothing in the codebase had. Fix: added `data-tour="lazymind-button"` + `data-tour="command-palette"` to the TopBar CTAs and switched the tour to those selectors with `placement: 'bottom'`. **168/168** tests passing across 24 files. Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13171---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.17.0] — Workflow rename + delete + a real modal (2026-04-27)

v1.3.16.0 shipped a picker that could create workflows via `window.prompt` (yes, browser-native and ugly). This release replaces that with a focused, autofocused, Esc-closable modal (`WorkflowFormModal`) used for both create and rename, and adds per-row rename + delete affordances directly on each picker row. Hover or focus reveals the action cluster — resting state stays a clean list. Delete asks for `window.confirm`, DELETEs via the existing endpoint, and routes back to `/canvas/default` if you nuked the active workflow (which falls through to `getOrCreateDefaultWorkflow`, so even deleting the last workflow creates a fresh one instead of crashing). Rename updates the picker's label in-place by writing to the canvas store directly. **168/168** tests passing across 24 files. Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13170---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.16.0] — Per-workflow URLs + workflow picker (2026-04-27)

The canvas is no longer single-workflow. `/workspace/[slug]/canvas/[id]` now hydrates the requested workflow specifically (via `GET /api/v1/workflows/[id]`), and a new picker dropdown in the canvas top-left lets you switch between workflows or create new ones without ever leaving the page. The magic word `default` in the URL still resolves to the workspace's default workflow, so existing sidebar links keep working unchanged. The picker lazy-loads its list on first open (no extra round-trip for users who never switch), supports click-outside + Escape, and POSTs to `/api/v1/workflows` for the "+ New workflow" action before routing to the freshly-created workflow. **168/168** tests passing across 24 files. Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13160---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.15.0] — Beacon flush + batched position writes (2026-04-27)

v1.3.14.0's per-node PATCH-on-debounce had a known gap: closing the tab inside the 600ms debounce window dropped the last drag. This release replaces the per-node PATCH cascade with a single batch endpoint (`POST /api/v1/nodes/positions` accepting up to 200 updates with one membership auth check per workspace touched) and a beacon flush on page teardown via `navigator.sendBeacon`. Every drag survives, even the one right before you hit ⌘W. The position-persist hook now uses a single shared 600ms timer that coalesces every dirty position into one batch POST instead of N parallel timers — for a user dragging 10 nodes for 5 seconds, this collapses ~10 separate PATCHes into 1 batch POST per window. **168/168** tests passing across 24 files. Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13150---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.14.0] — Canvas is fully persistent (2026-04-27)

v1.3.13.0 shipped read-hydration + position-drag-persist; this release closes the loop on every other canvas mutation. Creating a node from the toolbar or right-click menu, drawing an edge between two nodes, deleting either via Delete-key — all now POST/DELETE against `/api/v1/nodes` and `/api/v1/edges`. Refresh after any of those and the canvas comes back exactly as you left it. The "per-session scratchpad" comment is gone for good. Scratchpad fallback still works for dev-without-Supabase: when `currentWorkflowId` is null, mutations fabricate client ids exactly like before. New `lib/canvas/persist-helpers.ts` (`createNodeOnServer` and `createEdgeOnServer` — POST first, then push the server row into the store with the real UUID; fall back to client ids on failure so the action stays visible). New `useCanvasDeletePersist` hook diffs successive node and edge id sets; any UUID that disappears triggers a DELETE; skips client-fabricated ids so scratchpad deletes don't 404 the API; primes the diff on first hydration so the initial population doesn't fire spurious deletes. **168/168** tests passing across 24 files. Type-check clean, build clean. Remaining tiny follow-ups: flush pending position writes on beforeunload, and a per-workflow URL/picker (today's URL is permanently `/canvas/default`).

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13140---2026-04-27).

---

## [1.3.13.0] — Canvas hydrates from the server (2026-04-27)

The biggest "honest empty state" in the app — `WorkflowCanvas` had been a per-session scratchpad since v1.0, with a `// TODO: server-side persistence` comment hand-waving the gap. This release fixes half of it: the canvas now loads its real nodes and edges from the workspace's default workflow on every mount, and node position drags are persisted via debounced PATCH (600ms) so layouts survive a page refresh. New endpoint `GET /api/v1/workflows/default?workspaceId=<uuid>` (member-gated, wraps the existing `getOrCreateDefaultWorkflow` helper) so the canvas page — whose URL is permanently `/canvas/default` — can resolve the workspace's first workflow id without a UI-level picker. New hooks `useCanvasHydration` (parallel-fetches nodes + edges, normalizes server shape, stamps `currentWorkflowId` on the store) and `useCanvasPositionPersist` (watches UUID-shaped nodes, debounced PATCH, skips client-fabricated ids so scratchpad fallback still works). Also unblocks the v1.3.9.0 `ShareWorkflowDialog` — with a real `currentWorkflowId` in the store it's now wired into the canvas toolbar behind a Share button (hidden until hydration completes — no fake affordance). Node/edge create/delete persistence is intentionally deferred to v1.3.14.0 (those callsites need a coordinated refactor: POST first, then add to store with the server-issued UUID). Listed honestly in the changelog as known follow-ups. **168/168** tests passing across 24 files. Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13130---2026-04-27).

## [1.3.12.0] — CSV export for decisions everywhere (2026-04-27)

The Settings → Export page has been JSON-only since v1.0, and v1.3.11.0's exec report could only save as PDF. This release adds CSV everywhere decisions are exportable: a Format dropdown on the Decisions Only Export card (JSON / CSV), plus a CSV button next to "Print / Save as PDF" on the exec report. New endpoint `GET /api/v1/decisions/export-csv?workspaceId=<uuid>&range=7|30|90|365` returns a streamed CSV with `content-disposition: attachment` so browsers download instead of rendering. New utility `lib/utils/decisions-csv.ts` is a tiny RFC 4180-ish serializer (no Papa Parse dep) — escapes commas/quotes/newlines, doubles embedded quotes, joins arrays (`tags`, `stakeholders`, `options_considered`) with `; ` so they survive a single cell, CRLF line terminators. Stable column order so spreadsheet templates against the schema don't break across exports. **168/168** tests passing across 24 files (added 4 new in `tests/unit/decisions-csv.test.ts`). Type-check clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#13120---2026-04-27).

## [1.3.11.0] — Decision DNA executive report (2026-04-27)

The Decision DNA exec report had been a roadmap backlog item since v1.0 — listed as "PDF/exec report" with no implementation. Rather than add a heavy PDF render dependency for a single-page report, this release ships a server-rendered, print-optimized HTML page at `/workspace/[slug]/decisions/report` that uses the browser's native "Save as PDF". Header (workspace name, date range, generation timestamp) → 4-stat overview (total, avg quality, successful, failed with % of tagged) → status breakdown → top 5 quality decisions → failed-outcome lessons → full log → footer with provenance note. Range filter via `?range=7|30|90|365` (default: All). Print stylesheet hides the action bar and back link so the saved PDF is the report alone, page-broken cleanly with `break-inside-avoid` on each card. Linked from the Decisions page header next to "Log Decision" as an "Exec report" button. Roadmap *Remaining work* 5 → 4; fully wired 33 → 34; backend-wired 87% → 89%. Type-check clean, **164/164** tests passing, build clean.

## [1.3.10.0] — Multi-workspace switcher is real (2026-04-27)

The `WorkspaceSelector` in the sidebar has been display-only since v1.3.3.6 (round 15) — a static badge with no dropdown, no "create workspace" affordance, and no way to switch between workspaces a user belongs to. Users with multiple workspace memberships had to type `/workspace/{slug}` URLs by hand. This release ships the dropdown: click the workspace badge, get a lazy-loaded list of every workspace you're a member of (with role tags), click one to route to `/workspace/{slug}`, or hit "Create workspace" to drop into onboarding. Backed by a new authenticated endpoint `GET /api/v1/workspaces` that joins `workspace_members` to `workspaces` for the current user, sorted alphabetically. Outside-click + Esc dismissal, `aria-haspopup="menu"`, role per row, checkmark on the active row. Switching uses `router.push('/workspace/{slug}')` — the existing `WorkspaceHydrator` re-hydrates the Zustand store from the new slug, no extra wiring needed. Roadmap *Remaining work* 6 → 5; fully wired 32 → 33; backend-wired 84% → 87%. Type-check clean, **164/164** tests passing, build clean.

## [1.3.9.0] — Public Shared Canvas is real (2026-04-27)

The `/shared/[id]` route shipped with v1.0.0 and has rendered "Shared canvas not found / sharing is in development" for every URL ever since. This release ships the column, the link-issuance API, and the read-only viewer. New `workflows.share_token UUID` (nullable) with a partial unique index, plus `workflows.shared_at`. The token doubles as authorization for anonymous reads — the public route is the single chokepoint and queries via the service-role admin client filtered by token, sidestepping the need for a broad anon RLS policy. Sharing is opt-in per workflow; revoking nulls the token and instantly invalidates every existing public link; regenerating mints a fresh token (also instant). Viewer is a read-only ReactFlow canvas (`nodesDraggable=false`, `nodesConnectable=false`, `elementsSelectable=false`) reusing the existing 7 node types + `WorkflowEdge`; no member identities exposed; header shows workspace name + canvas name + description and a "Build your own canvas" CTA. New endpoints: `GET/PATCH /api/v1/workflows/[id]/share`. New importable `<ShareWorkflowDialog />` component (toolbar wiring deferred until the canvas store gains a current-workflow context). Roadmap fully wired count 31 → 32; backend-wired bar 82% → 84%. Type-check clean, **164/164** tests passing across 23 files (added 3 new in `tests/unit/shared-canvas.test.ts`), production build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1390---2026-04-27).

## [1.3.8.0] — Template Marketplace is real (2026-04-27)

The Templates page shipped with v1.0.0 and has rendered "Templates are in development" with a 5-card "categories planned for launch" preview ever since. This release deletes the placeholder and replaces it with a working catalog: 6 curated starter templates (Product Sprint, Architecture Decision Log, Feature Decision Log, OKR Tracker, Pre-launch Checklist, Client Project) across 4 categories, each shipping with seed nodes + edges + initial task statuses. Click "Install template" → a new `workflows` row is created in the caller's workspace, every seed node is inserted with a fresh UUID, edges are remapped from seed-id → real-uuid, an audit row is written, and the canvas opens. The catalog lives in `lib/data/template-catalog.ts` (not a DB seed) so templates ship with the deploy and iterate via PR review — no cross-workspace RLS gymnastics, no public templates table. No migration needed; reuses the existing `workflows` / `nodes` / `edges` tables. New `GET /api/v1/templates` (catalog summary, no DB read) and `POST /api/v1/templates/install` (zod-validated, service-role insert under `verifyWorkspaceMember`). Roadmap fully wired count 30 → 31; backend-wired bar 79% → 82%. Type-check clean, **161/161** tests passing across 22 files (added 4 new in `tests/unit/template-catalog.test.ts`), production build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1380---2026-04-27).

## [1.3.7.0] — Automation Builder is real (2026-04-27)

The Automations page shipped with v1.0.0 and has rendered "The automations engine is in development" with a `disabled` button and 4 fake preview rules ever since. This release deletes that placeholder and replaces it with a working WHEN/THEN engine. Two narrow trigger types in v1: `decision.logged` (fires from POST /api/v1/decisions after the existing notification + audit hooks) and `task.created` (fires from POST /api/v1/nodes when `type === 'task'`). Two narrow action types: `notification.send` with `{{variable}}` template interpolation pulling fields from the event payload (`{{question}}`, `{{qualityScore}}`, `{{title}}`, etc.), and `webhook.post` with HTTPS-only validation and a 5s `AbortSignal.timeout` cap. New `automations` table (RLS member-read, service-role-write); the existing `automation_runs.node_id` is now nullable and a new `automation_id` FK column ties each run to its rule. Engine runs synchronously after the underlying mutation succeeds, writes a row per execution, and swallows failures so a misconfigured automation can never 500 a user-facing write. UI: list view with WHEN/THEN pills + last 8 runs as colored chips (green=success, red=failed, hover for error), per-row enable/disable toggle, delete-with-confirm, "New automation" dialog with template interpolation hint. Roadmap fully wired count 29 → 30; backend-wired bar 76% → 79%. Type-check clean, **157/157** tests passing across 21 files (added 4 new in `tests/unit/automations.test.ts`), production build clean.

## [1.3.6.0] — Real-time multiplayer cursors land on the canvas (2026-04-27)

The roadmap's marquee feature — "Real-time Collaboration" — has rendered `<CollaborationOverlay collaborators={[]} />` since v1.0.0. This release wires it to actual Supabase Realtime presence. Two browsers signed in to the same workspace now see each other's cursors move in real time, with name pills, deterministic per-user colors, and pulse rings on the nodes each peer has selected. New `lib/realtime/use-collaboration.ts` hook subscribes to a presence channel keyed on `workspace_id`, broadcasts cursor in flow coordinates (so positions survive independent pan/zoom on each client) and projects incoming peer cursors back to screen coords via `flowToScreenPosition`. Cursor broadcasts are throttled to ~30 Hz; selection and typing flags re-track without resubscribing. Mobile is intentionally disabled. `WorkflowCanvas` is now split into an outer wrapper that provides `<ReactFlowProvider>` and an inner component that calls the hook. `CollaborationOverlay` cursors switched to `position: fixed` to align with viewport-relative coordinates. No new tables, no migration, no row writes — pure presence channel. Type-check clean, **153/153** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1360---2026-04-27).

## [1.3.5.0] — Two more features off the *Remaining work* list: notification preferences + audit log (2026-04-27)

v1.3.4.0 shipped the `notifications` table; this release adds the two tables that close out the bell-related work. New `notification_preferences` table — per `(workspace, user, event_type)` row with `in_app` + `email` toggles, `UNIQUE` on the triple for upsert-by-event, RLS for read-own + upsert-own. The notification fan-out path now consults preferences before inserting (mute a type and you stop receiving in-app rows for it). New `audit_log` table — append-only `(workspace_id, actor_id, action, resource_type, resource_id, metadata jsonb, ip inet, user_agent text, created_at)` with member-read RLS for tenant isolation and service-role-only inserts. Audit writes wired into the five real mutation paths: workspace PATCH (with diff metadata), decisions POST (with question + qualityScore), nodes POST (with type + title), nodes PATCH (with changed-keys list), nodes DELETE. New helpers: `lib/data/notification-preferences.ts` (`getPreferences` default-merged, `upsertPreference` with onConflict key) and `lib/data/audit-log.ts` (`recordAudit` extracts IP from `x-forwarded-for` first hop / `x-real-ip` plus user-agent, never throws; `listAuditLog` paginates by `created_at` cursor and hydrates actor name/email via the admin API). New endpoints: `GET/PATCH /api/v1/notification-preferences` and plan-gated `GET /api/v1/audit-log` (402 PLAN_GATE for Free/Starter, real data for Business+). Settings → Notifications tab rewritten as a real client component with per-event toggles + bulk save (email column visible but disabled with an honest hint until SMTP delivery ships). Activity → Audit Log replaces its static Enterprise placeholder with a live `AuditPanel`: Business+ workspaces see the cursor-paginated grid (Actor / Action / When / IP / User-Agent), Free/Starter see an upgrade CTA. Roadmap header bumped to v1.3.5.0; dropped #23 Notification Center, #12 Settings → Notifications, and #38 Activity → Audit Log from *Remaining work*; fully-wired count 25 → 28; backend-wired bar 66% → 74%. Type-check clean, **153/153** tests passing across 20 files (147 existing + 6 new), production build clean.

## [1.3.4.0] — First feature off the *Remaining work* list: the bell is real (2026-04-27)

After 17 rounds of demo-data eradication replaced fabricated fixtures with honest empty states, the *Remaining work* table in the roadmap listed 13 features still shipping as UI shells with no backend. This release ships the first one: **Notification Center**. New `notifications` table (Postgres enum, RLS, three policies). New `lib/data/notifications.ts` with `createNotification` / `notifyWorkspaceMembers` / `listNotifications` / `markNotificationRead` / `markAllNotificationsRead` — actor projection hydrated via the admin API so the bell can render real initials, names, and avatars. New API: `GET /api/v1/notifications?workspaceId=…`, `PATCH /api/v1/notifications` for mark-all-read, `PATCH /api/v1/notifications/[id]` for single mark-read. Two real event hooks wired: `POST /api/v1/decisions` fans out a `decision_logged` notification to every workspace member except the actor (with a deep link); `POST /api/v1/nodes` and `PATCH /api/v1/nodes/[id]` insert `task_assigned` when assignedTo parses as a UUID matching a workspace member (the column is free-form `VARCHAR(255)`, so assignment-by-email/name is silently skipped — honest). `NotificationCenter` rewired: fetches real data, polls every 60s, optimistic mark-read, click-through follows the stored deep link, real relative timestamps, Today / Yesterday / Earlier grouping. Self-actions suppressed (no self-notify). Notification failures never block the underlying mutation. Roadmap header synced to v1.3.4.0 with a new *Remaining work* table that drops Notification Center from the list. Type-check clean, **147/147** tests passing (143 existing + 4 new), build clean.

## [1.3.3.6] — Demo-data eradication round 17: two leftover lies (2026-04-26)

Two surfaces still leaked. (1) Pulse Dashboard's bottom card was titled "LazyMind Weekly Summary" with a `Sparkles` brand-icon and cyan gradient — framing it as AI-generated. The text was actually `buildSummary()`, a deterministic helper that concatenates pre-formatted sentences from real stats. Useful, honest data; misleading framing. Renamed to "This week, in one paragraph", swapped icon to `Activity`, dropped the gradient, added a "Computed deterministically … not AI-generated" footnote. (2) `WorkspaceTour` step 3 targeted `[aria-label="Switch workspace"]` — an element that no longer exists since round 15 made `WorkspaceSelector` display-only. The step description also promised a multi-workspace switcher dropdown that doesn't ship. New users got a missing spotlight + a description for a feature they couldn't find. Removed the step. Tour is now 9 steps. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1336---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.3.5] — Demo-data eradication round 16: LazyMind AI panel was a setTimeout mock (2026-04-26)

The biggest fake yet. The LazyMind AI panel advertised "Powered by Llama 3.3 70B via Groq" and rendered a staged 4-message conversation with fabricated Q2 Sprint analysis (12 tasks, 5 in progress, 4 decisions, 78/100 health) and a fake Weekly Digest. When users typed real questions, `sendMessage` ran a 1500ms `setTimeout` and returned a hardcoded canned response — the AI was never called. The infrastructure (`lib/ai/lazymind.ts`) was already wired with real Groq+Together fallback for `/api/v1/ai/analyze` and `/api/v1/ai/generate`, but the chat panel had no endpoint to call. Built `app/api/v1/ai/chat/route.ts` (auth, rate limit, zod validation, 503 AI_NOT_CONFIGURED when keys missing), wired the panel to it, dropped the staged demo conversation and structured-response render branches, replaced the dead "Send as email digest" button, and rewrote quick actions to ask real questions about Lazynext rather than promising fake workspace analysis. AI errors now render as amber `role: 'system'` notes instead of masquerading as AI responses. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1335---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.3.4] — Demo-data eradication round 15: app-shell sidebar (2026-04-26)

The persistent app shell, continued. Round 14 caught the TopBar; the Sidebar had an identical pattern. A "Workflows" section with three hardcoded entries (**Q2 Product Sprint** marked active, **Client Onboarding**, **Bug Triage**) rendered in every workspace's sidebar regardless of contents — there is no "workflow" primitive in the schema. Below them, a "+ New Workflow" dead button (no `onClick`). In the bottom action stack, the "LazyMind AI" button itself had no `onClick` (the actual toggle only fired from `TopBar`'s `lg:flex` button — so on tablet widths the only LazyMind entry point in the chrome was a dead button). Finally, `WorkspaceSelector` rendered as a `<button>` with a `ChevronDown`, hinting at a multi-workspace switcher dropdown that doesn't exist anywhere in the codebase. Removed the fake workflows section + dead button, wired LazyMind to `toggleLazyMind`, and converted `WorkspaceSelector` to a display-only div. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1334---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.3.3] — Demo-data eradication round 14: app-shell topbar (2026-04-26)

The persistent app shell. Every signed-in user, regardless of which workspace they were viewing, saw a `TopBar` with hardcoded text: workspace breadcrumb pinned to **"Acme Corp"** and a workflow sub-segment pinned to **"Q2 Product Sprint"** — there is no "named workflow" primitive in the schema. To the right, three avatar circles labeled **AP / PK / JR** rendered as a "Team members online" presence cluster, identical in spirit to the fake-team fixtures caught on the landing page (round 5) and the about page (round 12) — except this one rendered constantly, on every page, in the chrome that frames the entire authenticated product. Two more shell buttons did nothing: **"New Workflow"** (no `onClick`) and **"Share"** (no `onClick`, no `ShareModal` defined anywhere — verified via grep). Anyone evaluating the product saw a fully-staffed Acme Corp workspace with a working share button — none of which existed. Fixed by reading the real workspace name from `useWorkspaceStore` (already hydrated by `WorkspaceHydrator` at the `(app)` shell layer) and removing the fake presence cluster + dead buttons entirely. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1333---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.3.2] — Demo-data eradication round 13: in-app guide + notification center (2026-04-26)

The `/workspace/[slug]/guide` page advertised a six-section walkthrough with two sections that didn't reflect what ships. **Collaboration** listed real-time presence, in-context thread conversations, and @mentions — none of which work today (canvas renders `CollaborationOverlay collaborators={[]}` with no presence channel; the @mentions dropdown was a hardcoded fixture removed in round 2; the thread-node "in-context conversation" panel was replaced with an honest empty state in round 2 because the conversations were fabricated). **Productivity** listed Automations alongside the (real) command palette and (real) keyboard shortcuts — the rule builder/runtime ships in a future release; the page is currently an empty state. Meanwhile `NotificationCenter` rendered a "View all notifications" footer link with no `onClick` and no `/notifications` route to navigate to (verified absent), and a "Mark all read" button that was always visible even when the list was empty (the array is hardcoded `[]` until a `notifications` table ships). Fixed without touching the 40 i18n locale files — orphaned translation keys are harmless. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1332---2026-04-26).

---

## [1.3.3.1] — Demo-data eradication round 12: about / features / pricing honesty pass (2026-04-26)

Three more public-marketing pages telling stories that didn't match the product. **About** rendered a fabricated three-person team — "Avas Patel · Founder & CEO", "Priya Shah · Head of Design", "Rahul Dev · Lead Engineer" — with colored avatars and titles, when Lazynext is currently a one-founder operation. Same fake-social-proof pattern caught on the landing page in round 5 — the invented teammates render alongside the real founder so a prospect can't tell which is real. **Features** described Pulse as "Real-time health metrics" with "burndown charts" (refreshes on page load, no streaming; the burndown chart was replaced with an honest empty state in round 2's pulse refactor) and described Automations with two concrete WHEN/THEN examples even though the page is currently an empty state with no rule builder. **Pricing** sold four features that don't ship: Team plan promised "Import from Notion / Linear / Trello" (only the CSV path is wired); Business plan listed "Automation engine" (empty-state page), "Custom templates" (no `templates` table), and "Data export (JSON / CSV / PDF)" (only JSON works). The comparison table at the bottom repeated the same lies in matrix form. All three pages corrected to match what actually ships in v1.3.3.1. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1331---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.3.0] — Demo-data eradication round 11: marketing comparison + changelog (2026-04-26)

The two highest-stakes pages a prospect visits before signing up were both lying. The Comparison page (`/comparison`) showed a green checkmark for Lazynext on **every** row, including features that aren't built: Real-time collaboration (`CollaborationOverlay` is rendered with a hardcoded empty `collaborators={[]}` prop — no presence channel, no cursor sync), Template marketplace (templates page is an empty state, no `templates` table), Automation builder (also an empty state), Global pricing (a marketing claim, not a comparable feature). The Marketing Changelog page (`/changelog`) was even more directly stale: a hardcoded `entries` array pinned **v1.0.0.0** with the **"Latest"** ribbon while the actual production version was **v1.3.2.9** — every prospect saw a release from over twenty rounds ago marketed as the newest thing. Both fixed honestly: comparison page rebuilt with a 4-state cell legend (`shipped` / `partial` / `in development` / `not supported`), three new differentiator rows added (AI quality scoring, outcome reminder loop, public decision pages) with one-line "why this matters" captions, indigo→brand lime per the design system. Marketing changelog converted to a server component that reads the repo's `CHANGELOG.md` at request time (5min ISR), parses the version headings + Theme line + section list items, and renders type-coded badges. The Latest ribbon now sits on whatever version is genuinely latest. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1330---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.2.9] — Demo-data eradication round 10: Settings page wired to real workspace API (2026-04-26)

Three more dead UI shells caught on the Settings page. (1) The General tab pre-filled `defaultValue="My Workspace"` and `defaultValue="my-workspace"` regardless of the actual workspace, with a "Save changes" button that had no `onClick`. (2) A "Delete workspace" button that also had no `onClick`. (3) A Notifications tab with four toggles (Task assigned / Decision review / Weekly digest / Thread mentions) all rendered in the brand "on" state with `<button>` elements that had no handlers and no persistence layer (no `notification_preferences` table exists in the schema). All three: the textbook "looks like a real settings page, does nothing" pattern. New `PATCH` and `DELETE` handlers added to `app/api/v1/workspace/[slug]/route.ts` with proper schema validation, role gates, and slug-collision detection. The Settings General tab now hydrates from `useWorkspaceStore`, saves through the real PATCH (with redirect on slug change and human-readable error mapping), and the Danger Zone has a real two-step confirm before calling DELETE. Notifications tab replaced with an honest "per-event toggles ship once the `notification_preferences` table lands" empty state. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1329---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.2.8] — Demo-data eradication round 9: ImportModal — restore real CSV (2026-04-26)

A partial walk-back of round 6's overcorrection. Round 6 (v1.3.2.5) replaced the entire ImportModal with an honest "Import flows are in development" empty state because every connector in the wizard simulated work that wasn&apos;t real. After shipping, a closer audit of `app/api/v1/import/route.ts` revealed the **CSV path was actually live** — the API receives `source: 'csv'` with an inline `data` array of `{ title, type, status?, data? }` items, creates a `workflows` row, and inserts each item as a `nodes` row in the workspace. The OAuth-based connectors only return a fake `jobId` with `status: 'queued'` and never run, but CSV ingestion is fully functional. Round 6 threw both away. This round restores CSV upload as a real working flow: file is parsed in the browser with a minimal RFC 4180-ish parser (handles quoted fields, embedded commas, double-quote escapes), mapped to the API&apos;s expected shape (auto-detects `title`/`name`/`task`/`subject` for the title column, optional `type` column normalized against the 7 valid node types, optional `status` column, all other columns rolled into the per-node `data` field), and POSTed to `/api/v1/import` with `source: 'csv'`. On success, shows the real imported count returned by the API. The 5 OAuth connectors remain visible but visually disabled with `Soon` tags — honest about the roadmap. The lesson: round 6&apos;s "delete everything fake" instinct was right, but verify the API surface first; sometimes the backend already works and the frontend was just disconnected. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1328---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.2.7] — Demo-data eradication round 8: onboarding fake "84/100" score (2026-04-26)

The onboarding-flow lie. Every new user signing up for Lazynext landed on a 3-step "Create Workspace" flow whose final step asked them to log their first decision (Question / Resolution / Rationale fields). On submit, the page showed confetti, animated a green circular score badge with a hardcoded **`84`** above `/100`, and declared "Your workspace is ready! Great first decision. Your team is going to love this." Except — the decision was never saved. `handleLogDecision` did exactly four things: `setShowSuccess(true)`, `setShowConfetti(true)`, two `setTimeout` calls for animation. No fetch. No POST. No score calculation. The 84 was a constant. Then "Go to Workspace" finally created the workspace via the real `/api/v1/onboarding/workspace` endpoint and navigated, leaving the user with an empty workspace and a memory of a decision that was never logged. The default Question field was also pre-filled with "Which database should we use?" — a sample question masquerading as the user&apos;s own. This was the **first impression** of the entire product — the moment a new user formed their belief about what "Decision DNA" actually is. It promised AI scoring of every decision and demonstrated that promise with a literal hardcoded `84`. Fixed end-to-end: `handleLogDecision` now creates the workspace, then POSTs the decision to `/api/v1/decisions`, then displays the real `quality_score` returned by the AI scorer. If scoring fails (e.g. AI keys missing in dev), a checkmark + honest copy ("Quality scoring kicks in once the AI keys are configured") replaces the score badge instead of fabricating a number. Pre-filled sample question cleared. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1327---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.2.6] — Demo-data eradication round 7: Export page wired to real endpoint (2026-04-26)

A subtle deception. A real, working `GET /api/v1/export?workspaceId=<uuid>` endpoint exists and returns a complete JSON snapshot of the workspace (workflows, nodes, edges, decisions with scores, schema version, timestamp). But the UI never called it. The "Export Full Workspace" button kicked off a `setInterval` that filled a fake progress bar with `Math.random() * 8` increments, transitioned to an "Export Ready!" success card showing a `workspace-export-2026-04-26.json` filename — and then the "Download File" button did nothing. The "Export Decisions" button had no `onClick` handler at all. The API note at the bottom claimed two endpoints existed (`GET /api/v1/export/workspace`, `GET /api/v1/export/decisions`) when in reality only one existed at a different path. Fixed end-to-end: both buttons now call the real endpoint, parse the JSON response, build a `Blob`, and trigger an actual browser download via a programmatic `<a download>` click. Workspace ID resolved from `useWorkspaceStore`. Decisions-only export filters the same payload client-side by date range (since no separate decisions endpoint exists, the UI is honest about that). Real error surfacing via red banner. Fake CSV/PDF format options removed (the API only emits JSON). The most satisfying fix in the eradication series — backend was already there, the frontend just had to use it. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1326---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.2.5] — Demo-data eradication round 6: ImportModal — the fake Notion import (2026-04-26)

The most directly misleading flow in the entire app. The Import Data modal at `/workspace/[slug]/import` opened a 3-step wizard that simulated a complete Notion import end-to-end. Step 1: choose source. Step 2: review preview mapping (Pages → DOC nodes, etc.). Step 3: a fake "Connect & Start Import" button kicked off `setInterval(..., 200)` that filled three fake progress bars (Docs / Tasks / Connections) using `Math.random() * 15` increments until they all hit 100%, then transitioned to a green checkmark success screen claiming "12 docs, 24 tasks, and 18 connections imported" alongside a fake terminal log: `✓ Connected to Notion workspace · ✓ Importing pages as DOC nodes... · ✓ Importing databases as TASK nodes... · ⚠ Skipped 2 embedded images (not supported) · ✓ Building edge connections...`. None of it was real. There is no OAuth handshake, no ingestion endpoint, no schema mapper. Clicking "Go to Workflow" in the success screen just closed the modal and the workspace stayed empty. Users who tried to import their data and watched the fake terminal log scroll by were the most directly deceived audience the app had. Replaced with an honest version: planned connector list with `Soon` tags, an amber "Import flows are in development" notice explaining the OAuth + mapper + pipeline ship together, and a `mailto:hello@lazynext.com` CTA in place of the fake "Connect" button. Type-check clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

## [1.3.2.4] — Demo-data eradication round 5: landing-page social proof (2026-04-26)

The two highest-conversion sections of the public landing page were both fabricated, and they were rendering to every prospect visiting lazynext.com. **`SocialProofBar`** sat directly under the hero and claimed "Trusted by 1,200+ teams across 40+ countries" with six skeleton logo bars meant to imply real customer logos. **`TestimonialsSection`** rendered the "Loved by teams who ship" grid with three fabricated testimonials — "Priya Raghavan, Head of Product at FlowStack", "Arjun Krishnamurthy, CTO at NexaBuild", "Sara Mehta, Engineering Manager at DevCraft" — quoting them on specific outcomes ("we killed 5 subscriptions in one week", "Monday planning went from 45 minutes to 12 minutes — we timed it") at companies that don&apos;t exist. These weren&apos;t styled as placeholders; they rendered with five amber stars and looked indistinguishable from real testimonials. The most direct kind of conversion deception. Both component files deleted; both removed from `app/(marketing)/page.tsx`. Landing flow is now Hero → Problem → Primitives → DecisionDNA → LazyMind → ConsolidationMap → Pricing → CTA. The product story stands on its own. Real social proof goes back when real customers exist. Type-check clean, lint clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1324---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.2.3] — Demo-data eradication round 4: templates, shared canvas, blog (2026-04-26)

After three rounds clearing 17 surfaces (workspace pages, canvas + panels, account-scoped pages), a fourth sweep caught three more demo-data hot spots. **The Templates page** was a fully-fake "marketplace" — six made-up templates with invented popularity stats (128 / 89 / 64 / 45 / 32 / 156 stars; 342 / 215 / 156 / 98 / 74 / 489 installs), categories, search, and a fake "Install Template" button that flipped a state flag and showed a fake success modal without actually creating any nodes. There is no `templates` table, no install endpoint, and no ratings system. **The public `/shared/[id]` page** was a particularly nasty fake: every UUID-shaped path rendered the same hardcoded 5-node graph ("Product Roadmap → Choose Database → Implement Auth, Design Review, Build API") with fake share-modal analytics ("24 total views / 8 unique visitors / 2m avg time"). Anyone hitting the URL — including search engines and link-checkers — got fabricated content. **The marketing Blog listing** linked to four posts but only `launching-lazynext` had a real article body in `[slug]/page.tsx`; the other three (`decision-dna`, `graph-native`, `global-first`) 404'd when clicked. All three surfaces gone: Templates rewritten as an honest "Templates are in development" page with planned categories. `/shared/[id]` is now a server-rendered "Shared canvas not found" page that points users to the working `/d/[slug]` public-decision route. Blog listing now reflects reality with the single real post + an "More posts on the way" placeholder. Type-check clean, lint clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1323---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.2.2] — Demo-data eradication round 3: profile, billing, integrations, export, dead legacy panel (2026-04-26)

Round-1 (v1.3.2.0) cleared the five workspace pages, round-2 (v1.3.2.1) cleared the canvas + notifications + decision-health + detail panels. A third sweep found that **the entire Account → Profile page** was hardcoded — every user opened "Account Settings" and saw "Avas Patel · avas@lazynext.com · Founder & Developer", a fake "Side Project" workspace alongside the real one in the workspace switcher, three fake browser sessions with fake IPs (`MacBook Air · 104.xx.xx.42 · San Francisco`, `iPhone 15 · Safari`, `Windows PC · Firefox · 82.xx.xx.88 · London, UK`), and three hardcoded "Connected Accounts" toggles (Google/GitHub/Slack with fake states). **The Billing page** invented four invoices, a `•••• 4242` Visa card, a "Next billing: May 1, 2026" date, and four hardcoded usage counts (342 nodes, 47 decisions, 23 LazyMind queries, 1.2 GB storage) bearing no relationship to the actual workspace. **The Integrations page** showed Slack and Notion as already connected with active "Disconnect" buttons, plus a fake masked API key (`lnx_sk_••••...`) with copy/regenerate controls behind a flow that did nothing. **The Export page** invented three past exports with fake sizes/dates and an "Export 47 Decisions" button hardcoded regardless of the real count. All gone. Profile is now a server component reading the real Supabase user (email, `user_metadata.full_name`, `avatar_url`, `app_metadata.providers`) and a real workspace list via `getUserWorkspaces`. Billing is split into server + client — real plan, real seat count, real `getBillingUsage` counts, and the entire Payment Method + Billing History sections replaced by an honest "Open Gumroad portal" link (since payments actually live there). Integrations shows an honest empty state with disabled "Notify me" buttons on the Coming-soon row. Export gets an empty state and a dynamically-generated filename. Also deleted the orphaned `NodeDetailPanelLegacy.tsx` (carrying yet another fake "Priya / Avas / PlanetScale" thread) and inlined a minimal `FallbackPanel` for node types without a dedicated panel. Three new helpers: `safeAuthUser`, `getUserWorkspaces`, `getBillingUsage`. Type-check clean, lint clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1322---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.2.1] — Demo-data eradication round 2: canvas, notifications, decision health, settings, panels (2026-04-26)

Round-1 (v1.3.2.0) cleared the five workspace pages. A follow-up sweep found seven more surfaces with hardcoded "Avas Patel / Priya Sharma / Raj Kumar / Fix auth redirect bug" fixtures that every user saw regardless of which workspace they opened. **The empty canvas auto-injected 5 demo nodes** ("Ship onboarding v2", "Fix auth redirect bug", "Use Supabase for Auth + DB?", etc.) into every fresh session — so new users opened their workspace and instantly saw fabricated work assigned to people who don't exist. **The global notification bell** (visible on every page in the topbar) rendered 8 fake alerts attributed to teammates the user had never invited. **The Decisions Health dashboard** was 100% fixture-driven — fake leaderboards, fake quality trends, fake tag clouds, fake "3 untagged decisions need attention" alerts. **The Settings → Members tab** hardcoded a single "Avas Patel · avas@lazynext.com · Owner" row that displayed even to users who weren't Avas. **The three canvas detail panels** (thread, decision detail, task detail) shipped fake conversations including a full Supabase-vs-PlanetScale-vs-Firebase comparison table, fake "Avas Patel · Apr 2, 2026" Made-by rows on every decision, fake @mention dropdowns, and three fake hardcoded subtasks ("Wireframe review / API integration / QA testing") on every task. All gone. The Decisions Health page is now a server component computing real WoW deltas, real quality buckets, real outcome donut, real 7-week trend (refetched independently so a `period=7d` filter doesn't truncate the trend window), real top decision makers grouped by `made_by` with name resolution via `getWorkspaceUsers`, real type breakdown, real tag counts, and a real stale-untagged list that links to the actual decisions. LazyMind insight is now generated from real signal — surfacing low-quality %, untagged %, or strong-outcome praise based on which threshold trips. The other surfaces show honest empty states until their data hooks land. Type-check clean, lint clean, **143/143** tests passing, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1321---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.2.0] — Demo-data eradication: Tasks, Members, Activity, Pulse, Automations on real Supabase (2026-04-26)

Five core workspace pages — Tasks, Members, Activity, Pulse, Automations — were rendering hardcoded "Avas/Priya/Rahul/Sana" fixtures regardless of who was logged in or which workspace they were viewing. Every user saw the same four fake teammates and the same fake "Fix auth redirect bug" task. New users saw a populated-looking team that didn't exist. This release ripped out every fake array and wired four of the five surfaces to live Supabase. Tasks: full CRUD against the `nodes` table with board/list views, an Add Task modal that POSTs to `/api/v1/nodes`, and optimistic status changes via PATCH. Members: real `workspace_members` joined with `auth.users` via service-role admin client, real owner detection via `workspace.created_by`, real per-member task/decision counts, honest invite modal with copy-link share. Activity: real timeline composed from `decisions` + `nodes` + `messages` tables, grouped Today/Yesterday/older; audit log tab honestly shows Enterprise-only empty state instead of fake IP-address rows. Pulse: 12-query parallel aggregate computing tasks-done-this-week vs last-week, overdue, decisions/week, avg quality/week, threads/week, real 7-day completion histogram, and per-member workload — the fake sprint burndown is replaced with a real bar chart of daily completions. Automations gets an honest "engine in development" empty state — building a real engine requires triggers, actions, executor (Inngest), tests, and full UI round-trip; shipping fake-but-non-functional UI in the meantime would mislead users. Five new helpers in `lib/data/workspace.ts`. **143/143** tests passing, type-check clean, lint clean, build clean.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1320---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.1.1] — WCAG contrast sweep + final logo drop-in (2026-04-26)

Boomerang fix on the v1.3.1.0 rebrand. With brand flipped to lime `#BEFF66`, every surface that paired `bg-brand` with `text-white` (passed AA on cobalt) now failed AA on lime. Found ~60 instances and swept them with a regex transform: `text-white` → `text-brand-foreground` (`#0A0A0A` near-black) wherever it sits in the same className as `bg-brand` / `bg-brand-hover`. Two `bg-white text-brand` CTAs (lime-text on white, also fails AA) upgraded to `bg-slate-950 text-brand` — black-pill-with-lime-text, mirroring the logo's color pair for max brand recognition. Manually rebuilt the entire auth left brand panel (gradient `from-brand to-brand-hover`) replacing legacy cobalt-era `text-blue-100`/`200` with `text-brand-foreground/75` opacity variants. Pricing featured tier (entire card body bg-brand) and CTA banner (entire section bg-brand) fully recolored. Final logo PNGs dropped into `Lazynext_Logo.png` + the three `public/logo*.png` paths; sidebar/topbar 24×24 slots switched from `/logo-dark.png` (full wordmark, illegible at that size) to `/icon.svg` (mark-only). 65 files touched, type-check clean, build clean, **143/143** tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1311---2026-04-26).

## [1.3.1.0] — Rebrand to black-on-lime logo identity (2026-04-26)

Cobalt `#4F6EF7` retired. Lime `#BEFF66` is now the primary brand accent across the platform — Tailwind tokens, CSS variables, marketing connectors, the central landing-page "Lazynext" card (now mirrors the logo's lime + black pairing), canvas edge selection, Decision DNA quality-trend chart, email templates, OG image card, apple-icon, favicon SVG, and PWA `theme_color`. Lime is enforced as an **accent only**; full-page lime backgrounds were rejected as unprofessional for a SaaS surface. Text on lime is always near-black `#0A0A0A` (WCAG AA pairing, matches the logo mark). Brand voice and the 7 functional node-type colors are unchanged. New `brand.foreground` Tailwind token added to lock in the contrast pair. Type-check clean, build clean, **143/143** tests passing.

## [1.3.0.6] — CSP unblocks Sentry replay's blob: worker on every page (2026-04-26)

Live `/qa` dogfood across 17 public routes (`/`, `/pricing`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/about`, `/features`, `/blog`, `/changelog`, `/comparison`, `/contact`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/docs`, `/careers`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`, `/d/[slug]`) found the same console error firing on every page: `Refused to create a worker from 'blob:...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'. Note that 'worker-src' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.` Sentry session replay (`replayIntegration` in `sentry.client.config.ts`, `replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0`) bundles its compression as a `blob:` Web Worker. Without an explicit `worker-src`, browsers fall back to `script-src` — which had no `blob:` — and refuse to spawn the worker, so every error replay capture silently failed. Added explicit `worker-src 'self' blob:` and `blob:` to `script-src`. New regression test `tests/unit/csp.regression-001.test.ts` (4 assertions) locks in the directive. Type-check clean, build clean, **143/143** tests passing.

## [1.3.0.5] — Surface real workspace-resolve failure reason (2026-04-24)

v1.3.0.4 added a self-healing inline fetch but production still showed the generic “No workspace selected” toast — meaning the API was actually returning non-200 and we couldn’t tell why. `resolveWorkspaceId()` now returns `{ok, reason, status}` and `UpgradeModal`’s click handler maps each reason to a specific toast (403 → “not a member”, 404 → “workspace not found”, 401 → “session expired”). 139/139 tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1305---2026-04-24).

---

## [1.3.0.4] — Self-heal workspace ID on click (2026-04-24)

Killed the race where an impatient click could beat the v1.3.0.3 layout-mount hydrator and still fire “No workspace selected.” `handleChoose()` now calls `resolveWorkspaceId()` which prefers the Zustand store but falls back to `useParams().slug` + an inline `GET /api/v1/workspace/[slug]`, then primes the store on success. Error toast only fires when both paths legitimately fail. 139/139 tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1304---2026-04-24).

---

## [1.3.0.3] — Hydrate workspace store at layout mount (2026-04-24)

Fixed the production bug where `UpgradeModal` guarded on `workspace?.id` from an empty Zustand store — `setWorkspace` was only called in tests, never in production. Clicking *Choose Team* fired four “No workspace selected” toasts and blocked checkout entirely. Added `GET /api/v1/workspace/[slug]` (auth + membership-scoped, dev-fallback) and a `WorkspaceHydrator` client component mounted in the workspace layout alongside `WmsHydrator`. Also silently fixes `WorkspaceSelector` showing a literal “Workspace” fallback. Realigned `VERSION` (was drifting at 1.1.0.0). 139/139 tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1303---2026-04-24).

---

## [1.3.0.2] — Align deploy docs to v1.3’s 4-product Gumroad setup (2026-04-23)

v1.3 only shows two paid tiers (Team + Business). `DEPLOY.md` and `README.md` still told founders to create six Gumroad products across three tiers, which would over-provision two dead `BUSINESS_*` URLs. Realigned both docs (`FOUNDER-SETUP-WALKTHROUGH.md` already had it right) and dropped the stale “v1.0.0.1” preamble stamp from `DEPLOY.md`. Docs + version bump only — no code changes.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1302---2026-04-23).

---

## [1.3.0.1] — Align internal trial duration 14 → 30 days (2026-04-23)

Gumroad’s membership trial selector only offers “one week” or “one month” — no 14-day preset. Picking “one month” means subscribers see 30 days at checkout, which conflicted with the internal `TRIAL_DAYS = 14` driving the Inngest downgrade cron. Aligned to **30 days everywhere**: `lib/utils/constants.ts`, all customer-facing copy (pricing CTAs, FAQ, hero subhead, `FeatureGate` paywall, platform-walkthrough), test expectations, Inngest cron comments, billing-architecture doc, founder walkthrough, Feature 22 design artifacts, Feature 02 mockup FAQ (also fixed stale “Pro trial” → “Business trial”), Business Model Canvas (4 mentions), and Blueprint V9 §71. Untouched: blueprint inactivity-timer / onboarding-mode lines (different concept), historical v1.1/v1.2 changelog entries (audit trail), existing `workspace.trial_ends_at` timestamps (forward-only). Lint clean, type-check clean, 139/139 tests passing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1301---2026-04-23).

## [1.3.0.0] — Pricing to blueprint sweet spot + Enterprise unblocked (2026-04-22)

Team $15 → **$19/seat/mo** monthly, $12 → **$15/seat/mo** annual ($180/yr). Business holds at $30 (blueprint Section 41 flags $39 as losing the Founder ICP; $30 is the overlap where Drowning-Founder ceiling meets Ops-PM floor). Enterprise anchor changes from "From $49/seat · 15-seat minimum" to **"Custom pricing — contact sales"** — the 15-seat floor was turning away real 10-14 seat prospects. v1.2 subscribers grandfathered at $15/$30 for life at the Gumroad subscription layer.

Explicitly deferred to separate ships: Solo tier (needs `plan_enum` migration + 2 Gumroad products + checkout schema), India PPP (needs Razorpay or dual-provider mess).

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1300---2026-04-22).

---

## [1.2.0.0] — Decision Health to Team + parity pricing + Founding Member lock-in (2026-04-20)

Moved Decision Health Dashboard (hero feature) down from Business to Team so the entry tier isn't gutted. Team pricing $12 → **$15/seat/mo** monthly, $10 → **$12** annual; Business $24 → **$30** / $20 → **$24**. Added Founding Member promotion: first 100 paying workspaces grandfather-lock whatever list price is live when they subscribe. `/api/v1/billing/founding-member` returns live remaining count; `<FoundingMemberBanner />` on the pricing page surfaces it.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1200---2026-04-20).

## [1.1.0.0] — Gumroad billing migration + per-seat pricing (2026-04-20)

Shipped on `feature/billing-gumroad-migration` — 9 commits, 48+ files, +~1,900/−2,690.

**Billing provider swap.** Full Lemon Squeezy → Gumroad rip-and-replace. New `/api/v1/webhooks/gumroad/[secret]` route with URL-secret auth (timing-safe), handles every Gumroad resource (sale, subscription_updated/_ended/_cancelled/_restarted, refunded, dispute). Schema migration `20260420000001_gumroad_migration.sql` renames `ls_* → gr_*` on `workspaces`. Portal URL derived as `app.gumroad.com/subscriptions/<id>/manage`. `@lemonsqueezy/lemonsqueezy.js` removed (−57 transitive packages). CSP updated. All marketing copy swapped.

**Per-seat pricing (v1.1 launch prices, since superseded).** Launched as display names Team ($12/$10 per seat), Business ($24/$20 per seat), Enterprise (custom/sales-led). Paid tiers all unlimited members/nodes/workflows; AI queries soft-cap (10 → 100 → 500 → unlimited per seat/day). Slug → display mapping preserved — no enum migration required. These prices were bumped in v1.2 and again in v1.3 — see entries above.

**14-day Business trial + auto-downgrade.** `handleTrialExpiryScan` Inngest cron (02:00 UTC daily) downgrades unpaid expired trials to free.

**Founding Member promotion.** First 100 paying workspaces get 30% off for life. Live counter API (`/api/v1/billing/founding-member`, 5-min cache) + `<FoundingMemberBanner />` on the pricing page showing remaining spots.

**End-to-end upgrade funnel.** Rewritten `UpgradeModal` posts to `/api/v1/billing/checkout` and redirects to Gumroad. Seven variants with contextual copy. Enterprise routes to `/contact?topic=enterprise`. New global trigger store — `useUpgradeModal.getState().show('health-gate')` works from anywhere.

**Paywall on gated pages.** New `<FeatureGate>` wrapper applied to Decision Health, Automations, and PULSE — renders children when plan unlocks, else a lock card with "Upgrade to <Tier>" CTA.

**Test coverage.** +14 integration tests (`tests/integration/gumroad-webhook.test.ts`) covering every webhook code path. Suite 119 → 133.

**Docs.** New `docs/references/billing-architecture.md` (311 lines) — single source of truth. `docs/releases/PR-gumroad-migration.md` has the merge checklist.

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#unreleased) for the full file-by-file breakdown.

## [1.0.0.1] — 2026-04-18

Hardening follow-up. Structured observability on `scoreDecision` + Playwright E2E suite for `/d/[slug]`. See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1001---2026-04-18) for full details.

## [1.0.0.0] — 2026-04-18

**Decision Intelligence Platform** launch. 4-dimension AI decision scorer, public `/d/[slug]` pages with OG + ISR, Workspace Maturity Score progressive exposure (L1–L4), outcome reminder Inngest loop, schema migration `00002_decision_intelligence_spine.sql`, global `Cmd+Shift+D`. Fixes ISSUE-001 (`/signup` → `/sign-up` link audit), ISSUE-002 (scorer silently fell back on fenced JSON), ISSUE-003 (placeholder env DNS hang). See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md#1000---2026-04-18) and [docs/releases/v1.0.0.0.md](releases/v1.0.0.0.md).

## [Unreleased]

<!-- Features merged to main but not yet released/deployed. All v1.0–v1.3 work has shipped; the items below are kept as the historical pre-v1.0 build log. -->

### Added (pre-v1.0 build log — archival)

- **Page-Specific Skeleton Screens (2026-04-15)** — Created `components/ui/Skeleton.tsx` with 12 reusable skeleton primitives (Skeleton, SkeletonCircle, SkeletonText, SkeletonCard, SkeletonStat, SkeletonTableRow, SkeletonButton, SkeletonTabs, SkeletonHeader, SkeletonSearch, SkeletonLight, SkeletonLightCard). Added shimmer animation keyframe to tailwind.config.ts. Replaced all 22 loading.tsx files with page-specific responsive layouts matching each page's actual structure. All skeletons are mobile-first (sm/md/lg/xl breakpoints) and use `motion-safe:animate-shimmer` for prefers-reduced-motion compliance.

- **ARIA Landmarks & Skip Navigation (2026-04-15)** — Added "Skip to main content" links to app, marketing, and auth layouts. Added `id="main-content"` to all `<main>` elements (8 pages). Added `aria-label` to nav, aside, and footer landmarks. Fixed heading hierarchy on auth pages (h2→h1 for primary headings, h1→h2 for decorative brand panel). Added `autoComplete` attributes to all auth form inputs (`email`, `current-password`, `new-password`, `name`). Added `<noscript>` fallback message to root layout.

- **Form Accessibility Hardening (2026-04-15)** — Added `htmlFor`/`id` pairs to all labeled form inputs (settings, profile, export, members, templates), `aria-label` to standalone inputs (search bars, sort selects, toggle checkboxes, automation builder fields, task list checkboxes), and `aria-label` to icon-only buttons (close dialogs, pagination, delete actions, dismiss banners) across 8 page files.

- **Modal Focus Trap & Scroll Lock (2026-04-15)** — Created `useModalA11y` hook providing focus trap (Tab/Shift+Tab cycling within modal) and body scroll lock. Applied to all 6 modals: OutcomeReviewModal, UpgradeModal, ImportModal, KeyboardShortcutsModal, CommandPalette, GuidedTour. Added missing `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` to OutcomeReviewModal and GuidedTour. Hook accepts `enabled` flag for conditionally-rendered modals.

- **Page Title Metadata (2026-04-15)** — Added server-component `layout.tsx` with metadata exports for all 17 protected pages under `(app)/`. Each page now has a browser tab title via the `%s | Lazynext` template (e.g., "Decisions | Lazynext", "Tasks | Lazynext").

- **Navigation aria-current (2026-04-15)** — Added `aria-current="page"` to active navigation links in Sidebar (main + workspace sections), MobileBottomNav, and MarketingHeader (desktop + mobile). Imported `usePathname` in MarketingHeader for active state detection.

- **Semantic Time Elements (2026-04-15)** — Wrapped all date/time displays in semantic `<time>` elements with ISO 8601 `datetime` attributes across 6 files: DecisionDNASection, ThreadPanel, blog page, changelog page, billing history, activity audit log.

- **OG Image & Print Styles (2026-04-15)** — Added `og:image` and `twitter:images` to root layout metadata for social sharing previews. Added print-friendly `@media print` styles to globals.css (hide nav/sidebar/fixed elements, white background, show link hrefs).

- **Table Accessibility (2026-04-15)** — Added `scope="col"` to all `<th>` elements and `aria-label` to all `<table>` elements across 8 files (comparison, pricing, billing, automations, activity audit, decisions health, ThreadPanel, TablePanel). Wrapped Sidebar and MobileBottomNav links in `<ul>`/`<li>` for proper list semantics. Added `aria-live="polite"` to toast container and notification content area.

- **Motion-Safe Animations & Form A11y (2026-04-15)** — Replaced `animate-pulse` with `motion-safe:animate-pulse` in CollaborationOverlay, NotificationCenter badge, GuidedTour spotlight, and EmptyStates skeleton (4 components). Added `aria-describedby` linking auth form inputs to error messages in sign-in and sign-up. Added `aria-label` to DecisionQualityBadge (score + rating text) and automation cards (name + status). Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative hero SVG.

- **Zustand Selector Optimization & Final Motion-Safe (2026-04-15)** — Converted all Zustand store destructuring to individual selectors across all 3 stores (useCanvasStore in 8 files, useUIStore in 9 files) to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Fixed last 2 `animate-pulse` instances missing `motion-safe:` prefix (EmptyStates DecisionListSkeleton, decisions page success animation). Added `noValidate` to sign-in and sign-up forms for consistent custom validation UX.

- **Deep Polish Pass (2026-04-15)** — 8 commits (63-70) covering:
  - **Timer safety**: Fixed setTimeout leaks in shared canvas, integrations, and decisions modal (useRef + useEffect cleanup). Fixed export page setInterval leak.
  - **Accessibility**: `aria-invalid` on auth form inputs, `role="progressbar"` with `aria-valuenow`/`aria-valuemin`/`aria-valuemax` on all 18 progress bars (14 files), `title` attributes on 4 truncated text elements, RTL `dir` attribute for Arabic locale, `enterKeyHint="search"` on 5 search inputs and `enterKeyHint="send"` on chat input.
  - **Performance**: GuidedTour keyboard useEffect dependency array + `useCallback` on `next`/`prev` handlers, `motion-safe:` prefix on all 15 remaining Tailwind animation utility usages (slide-in-right, slide-in-up, scaleIn, fadeIn).
  - **Standards**: Replaced all 14 arbitrary `max-w-[1280px]` with standard Tailwind `max-w-7xl`. Upgraded footer `text-slate-400` → `text-slate-300` for better WCAG AA contrast. Added `maxLength` to all 13 remaining inputs/textareas. Guide page padding consistency (`md:px-8`).

- **Final Polish (2026-04-15)** — 2 commits (71-72) covering:
  - **Performance**: Removed duplicate Inter font import from globals.css (was loaded both via next/font/google in layout.tsx AND via CSS @import — eliminated redundant CDN request and double font download).
  - **Accessibility**: Added `aria-label` on SocialProofBar `<section>` for WCAG landmark naming.
  - **Verification**: Multiple consecutive audits across focus order, link purpose, button/link semantics, referrer policy, empty interactive elements, focus-visible usage, iframe loading, preconnect crossorigin, and Lighthouse-style meta checks — all returned ALL CLEAN.

- **Production Quality Pass (2026-04-13 → 2026-04-14)** — 48 cleanup commits covering:
  - **Security**: Fixed 15 IDOR vulnerabilities, hardened CSP (removed unsafe-eval, added media/object/base-uri/form-action directives), rate limiting on all 19 API routes, webhook HMAC idempotency, open redirect protection, template install access control, export UUID validation, `hasValidDatabaseUrl` guard on billing checkout, shared canvas UUID validation, `poweredByHeader: false`
  - **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA — heading hierarchy, form labels (htmlFor/id), aria-labels on OAuth/workspace/icon-only buttons, role="alert" on errors, keyboard handlers, password constraints, prefers-reduced-motion for all CSS animations
  - **i18n**: next-intl with 40 locales, 57 currencies, locale-aware pricing, LocaleSwitcher with SSR guard, native guide translations for 8 languages (es/fr/de/ja/ko/zh/hi/ar)
  - **SEO**: sitemap.ts, robots.ts, manifest.json, viewport metadata, OpenGraph/Twitter cards, apple-icon.tsx
  - **Testing**: 95 Vitest unit/integration tests (12 files), 92 Playwright E2E tests (4 files) — all passing
  - **Billing Migration**: Stripe+Razorpay → Lemon Squeezy (global MoR), updated all docs/schema refs
  - **Performance**: Canvas undo history capped at 50, decision search server-side ilike, lazy loading marketing sections via next/dynamic, crypto.randomUUID for toast IDs
  - **Reliability**: Timer cleanup in LazyMindPanel/ImportModal (useRef + cleanup on unmount), SSR guards on Zustand store methods (setCurrency/completeTour), favicon moved from app/ to public/ (was 500-ing)
  - **Feature Completion**: Weekly digest Inngest function now sends emails to workspace members, export handler generates JSON/CSV and stores in DB, AI fallback JSON parsing error handling
  - **Error Handling**: 23 error boundaries (all routes), onboarding workspace creation, Inngest retries (all 6 functions), workspace name maxLength validation
  - **Platform Guide**: Interactive tour (GuidedTour spotlight overlay, 10-step WorkspaceTour), PlatformGuide page with 6 sections, onboarding redirect, sidebar link, cookie-persisted tour state
