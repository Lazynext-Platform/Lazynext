# Changelog

All notable changes to Lazynext will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added — Decision Intelligence Platform
- **4-dimension AI decision scorer** (`lib/ai/decision-scorer.ts`) — scores every decision on clarity, data quality, risk awareness, and alternatives considered (0–100 each, equal-weighted). Primary LLM is Groq (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) with Together AI fallback. Falls back to a deterministic heuristic when AI is unavailable or returns unparseable output.
- **Public decision pages** at `/d/[slug]` — opt-in shareable pages with OG metadata, dimension breakdown bars, and 5-minute ISR revalidation. Only decisions with `is_public = true` are exposed.
- **Workspace Maturity Score (WMS)** progressive exposure (`lib/wms.ts`) — sidebar features unlock as workspaces mature: L1 (0 pts) decisions + outcomes only, L2 (15 pts) unlocks tasks + threads, L3 (35 pts) unlocks docs + tables, L4 (60 pts) unlocks canvas + automations + integrations. Power users can override via `power_user_override` flag.
- **WMS API endpoint** (`/api/v1/workspace/[slug]/wms`) with GET (read score + layer) and PATCH (toggle power user override).
- **Outcome reminder loop** — `handleOutcomeReminderScan` Inngest job scans daily for decisions past their `expected_by` date and emails the author. `outcome_reminder_sent_at` stamp prevents daily re-notification storms.
- **Weekly digest rewrite** — `handleWeeklyDigest` now summarizes decisions logged, outcomes recorded, and WMS progression per workspace.
- **Decision logged hook** — `handleDecisionLogged` fires AI scoring on create, stamps `score_breakdown`, `score_rationale`, `score_model_version`, and increments workspace WMS.
- **Schema migration** `00002_decision_intelligence_spine.sql`:
  - `decisions`: `expected_by`, `score_breakdown` (jsonb), `is_public`, `public_slug`, `score_model_version`, `score_rationale`, `outcome_reminder_sent_at`
  - `workspaces`: `wms_score`, `wms_updated_at`, `power_user_override`
  - `nodes`: `decision_id`, `operational_reason` + `nodes_decision_spine_check` constraint
- **`WmsHydrator` component** — hydrates WMS state into the workspace store on app boot without blocking layout.
- **Global `Cmd+Shift+D` shortcut** to log a decision from anywhere (`GlobalLogDecisionShortcut`).
- **20 new unit tests** covering WMS gating thresholds, feature unlocks, power user override, and decision scorer JSON parsing robustness (plain JSON, ```json fences, bare ``` fences, prose-wrapped responses, out-of-range clamping, AI failure fallback, weighted aggregate math).

### Changed
- **Marketing stubs** (`/careers`, `/contact`, `/docs`) now exist as public pages with CTAs pointing at the real `/sign-up` route.
- **Sidebar** filters visible nav items by WMS layer; "Show all N sections" button optimistically flips `power_user_override` without blocking on the network.
- **Placeholder env detection** (`lib/db/client.ts`, `lib/ai/lazymind.ts`) — pattern-matches common placeholder tokens (`your-project`, `your-service-role`, `example.supabase.co`, literal `placeholder`, `your-api-key`). Stock `.env.local` values no longer waste 7+ seconds on doomed DNS lookups; DB-touching routes now return fallbacks in under 250ms.
- **Decision creation API** (`app/api/v1/decisions/route.ts`) stamps AI score on create and increments workspace WMS in the same transaction.
- **Decision quality badge** displays the 4-dim breakdown inline.

### Fixed
- **ISSUE-001**: `/careers`, `/contact`, `/docs`, and `/d/[slug]` all linked to `/signup` (404). Updated 4 link sites to the real `/sign-up` route.
- **ISSUE-002**: Decision scorer silently fell back to heuristic every time Llama wrapped JSON in ```` ```json ... ``` ```` fences. Added `extractJson()` that strips fences and isolates the outermost `{…}` from prose. The "AI scores on 4 dimensions" headline now actually runs on AI.
- **ISSUE-003**: First-run UX hung for ~7.6 seconds on every DB-touching page when `.env.local` held stock placeholder values. Now returns safe fallbacks immediately.

### Migration notes
- Run `supabase db push` (or your equivalent) to apply `00002_decision_intelligence_spine.sql`.
- Existing decisions without `score_breakdown` will still render (badge gracefully degrades to the legacy single-score display).
- New workspaces start at `wms_score = 0` (L1).
- Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env.local` to enable AI scoring; without it, scoring falls back to the heuristic path automatically.
