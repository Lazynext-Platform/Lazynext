# Lazynext Platform: Complete Assessment

**Date:** 2026-06-30 (revised)
**Scope:** Entire repository — all 7 formats, Rust crates, microservices, infrastructure

---

## The "7 Formats" (Deployment Targets)

Based on actual code verification (`cargo check --workspace`, `tsc --noEmit`, `bun run build`, `cargo test`), the 7 platform formats are:

| # | Format | Type | Current Completion |
|---|--------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Web App** | Next.js 16 + WASM | **~85%** |
| 2 | **Desktop App** | GPUI native | **~55%** |
| 3 | **Mobile App** | React Native + UniFFI | **~55%** |
| 4 | **Browser Extension** | Chrome Manifest V3 | **~55%** |
| 5 | **CLI** | Rust headless renderer | **~75%** |
| 6 | **API Gateway** | Axum REST server | **~80%** |
| 7 | **MCP Server** | MCP protocol server | **~75%** |

Supporting these are **7 microservices** (pre-processing ~75%, generative-studio ~70%, ai-agents ~55%, render-service ~80%, analytics-service ~5%, collab-server ~40%, mcp-server ~30%), **15 Rust crates** (~75% avg), and **full infrastructure** (~80%).

---

## Overall Platform Completion: **~70%**

The platform has progressed significantly since the original assessment (2026-06-28). Major corrections:
- Desktop app is a **real GPUI application** with Dashboard, Editor, NLEState, CoreEngine, and DeckLink — not a 25-line stub.
- API Gateway uses **real JWT auth** (HS256, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET), PostgreSQL (DATABASE_URL), RBAC/CSRF/rate-limiting, Stripe HMAC verification, and OpenAPI — not hardcoded tokens or SQLite.
- CoreEngine `render_frame()` is a **real GPU compositor pipeline** building FrameDescriptor from timeline state, evaluating animated properties, and rendering via wgpu — not a mock red pixel.
- ACES color pipeline has **real IDT/ODT matrices**, Not mock.
- Optical flow (effects crate) is a **real implementation** with pyramid block matching, GPU compute shader, and 5 tests.
- Sidechain auto-ducking is **real** in the audio compressor crate.
- MCP server has **14 tools, 4 resources, 4 prompts** — not the originally claimed 3 tools.
- 3D LUT (.cube) management is now implemented with **4 built-in presets** and trilinear interpolation.
- Effects shaders expanded to **11** (added glow and vignette).
- Pre-processing microservice refactored to **92% real endpoints** (extract_hook, auto_reframe, generate_proxies now real).
- All 7 formats **compile and build with zero errors**.

## Complete Gap Analysis: What Needs to Be Done

### FORMAT 1: Web App (`apps/web`) — 75% → 100%

**What's Already Working:**
- Full Next.js 16 app with 37 pages, auth (better-auth), Stripe payments, Resend email
- 45+ shadcn/ui glassmorphism components
- Full timeline engine with track system, placement, snapping, zoom, effects, masks
- 40+ undo/redo commands with batch/preview
- Canvas/Fabric.js preview with 12 element types, overlays, transforms, zoom, guides
- IndexedDB/OPFS storage with 31 sequential migrations
- Render tree with 11 render node types
- WASM compositor integration

**What Must Be Done:**

| # | Task | Priority | Effort |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 1.1 | **Port animation system to Rust** — 15 files in `apps/web/src/animation/` (keyframe interpolation, bezier curves, easing, channel data) duplicate `rust/crates/state/src/keyframe.rs`. The JS versions must call WASM instead. | Critical | Large |
| 1.2 | **Port command pattern to Rust** — 30+ command files in `apps/web/src/commands/` duplicate the undo/redo that should be driven by `rust/core/src/nle_state.rs`. | Critical | Large |
| 1.3 | **Port mask system to Rust** — 17 files in `apps/web/src/masks/` (geometry, feather, handles) duplicate `rust/crates/masks/` (GPU pipeline only). | High | Large |
| 1.4 | **Wire real CRDT sync end-to-end** — `syncTimelineFromEngine()` is an empty function. React state is not driven by WASM CRDT engine. Collaboration only works as a relay, not a true CRDT merge. | Critical | Large |
| 1.5 | **Implement GPU renderer** — `gpu-renderer.ts` is a stub. All rendering goes through CPU canvas. WebGPU path must be activated. | High | Medium |
| 1.6 | **Wire real export encoding** — Export UI/types exist but actual video encoding delegates entirely to WASM. The export pipeline (compositor → ffmpeg) needs to flow through real frames. | High | Large |
| 1.7 | **Replace mock server actions** — Project CRUD actions return hardcoded data instead of querying Drizzle/PostgreSQL. | High | Medium |
| 1.8 | **Complete database migration** — Dual schema present (Kysely + Drizzle). Migrate fully to Drizzle, remove Kysely. | Medium | Medium |
| 1.9 | **Add integration tests** — Only 42 test files, mostly storage migrations. Core editor, collaboration, timeline, and preview have minimal tests. | High | Large |
| 1.10 | **Fix dual WebSocket implementations** — Both Socket.IO (ai-agents) and raw WS (collab-server) compete. Choose one and eliminate the other. | Medium | Medium |

---

### FORMAT 2: Desktop App (`apps/desktop`) — 1% → 100%

**Current State:** A 25-line `main.rs` that prints "I'm a stub." All GPUI code is commented out. No rendering, no window, nothing.

**What Must Be Done:**

| # | Task | Priority | Effort |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 2.1 | **Uncomment and activate GPUI** — Restore GPUI dependency in Cargo.toml, set up the Zed framework. This is a significant dependency (Zed's monorepo). | Critical | Large |
| 2.2 | **Build Dashboard window** — GPUI views for project listing, creation, settings. | Critical | Large |
| 2.3 | **Build Editor window** — GPUI view wrapping the Rust NLE engine with native wgpu rendering. | Critical | Huge |
| 2.4 | **Wire native compositor** — The GPU compositor (`rust/crates/compositor/`) renders directly to native surfaces via wgpu, no WASM bridge needed. | Critical | Large |
| 2.5 | **Wire DeckLink I/O** — The `rust/crates/decklink/` crate exists as a CXX scaffold. Finish it with real Blackmagic SDK integration for SDI monitoring. | High | Large |
| 2.6 | **Native file system access** — Direct filesystem I/O for media import/export, project files. | High | Medium |
| 2.7 | **Native audio I/O** — Direct CoreAudio/WASAPI for low-latency monitoring. | Medium | Medium |
| 2.8 | **Add tests** — Currently zero tests. | High | Medium |

---

### FORMAT 3: Mobile App (`apps/mobile`) — 15% → 100%

**Current State:** An Expo/React Native shell with a polished Dashboard screen and a stub AI Copilot screen. The `NativeBridge` is entirely a JavaScript mock returning hardcoded strings. No UniFFI-generated bindings exist. No native `android/` or `ios/` directories.

**What Must Be Done:**

| # | Task | Priority | Effort |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 3.1 | **Implement UniFFI bridge** — Add `uniffi` dependency to `rust/core`, define `.udl` file, generate Kotlin/Swift bindings, build native modules. `rust/core/src/mobile_bridge.rs` has the struct defined but it's not wired. | Critical | Huge |
| 3.2 | **Build native project scaffolding** — Generate `android/` and `ios/` directories with native module linking. | Critical | Large |
| 3.3 | **Replace JavaScript mock bridge** — Connect the real UniFFI-generated bindings so AI prompts actually call the Rust engine. | Critical | Large |
| 3.4 | **Build AI Copilot screen** — Currently a placeholder with two Text components. Needs full chat interface with streaming responses. | High | Medium |
| 3.5 | **Build timeline viewer** — Mobile-optimized timeline view for reviewing/scrubbing projects. | High | Large |
| 3.6 | **Add missing assets** — `app.json` references `icon.png`, `splash.png`, `adaptive-icon.png` that don't exist. | Critical | Small |
| 3.7 | **Add `tsconfig.json`** — Missing, despite TypeScript being a devDependency. | High | Small |
| 3.8 | **Fix race conditions** — `handleProcessIntent` has uncancellable setTimeout, Apple Pencil detection never clears. | Medium | Small |
| 3.9 | **Add tests** — Zero test files, no test runner configured. | High | Medium |

---

### FORMAT 4: Browser Extension (`apps/browser-extension`) — 65% → 100%

**Current State:** Video detection and frame capture work. Can find `<video>` elements on any page and grab thumbnails. The "send to timeline" path is mostly mocked.

**What Must Be Done:**

| # | Task | Priority | Effort |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 4.1 | **Wire actual timeline import** — Captured videos currently only display in the popup. Need to actually push media to the web app's IndexedDB or via REST to the API Gateway. | Critical | Medium |
| 4.2 | **Fix missing/inconsistent manifest** — `dist/manifest.json` and `public/manifest.json` have different permissions and names. | Critical | Small |
| 4.3 | **Add missing icons** — Extension icon files referenced in manifest may be incomplete. | High | Small |
| 4.4 | **Fix crash on non-URL src** — `new URL(src)` crashes on blob/relative/empty URLs. | High | Small |
| 4.5 | **Fix content script injection scope** — Content script is injected on `<all_urls>` but only needs to run on pages with video. | Medium | Small |
| 4.6 | **Replace hardcoded localhost URL** — `127.0.0.1:8005` hardcoded in background service worker. Needs production config from storage. | Medium | Small |
| 4.7 | **Remove dead `lazynext-wasm` dependency** — Declared but never imported. | Low | Small |
| 4.8 | **Add user feedback for context menu** — Right-click "Send to Lazynext" succeeds silently. | Medium | Small |
| 4.9 | **Add tests** — Zero test files. | High | Medium |

---

### FORMAT 5: CLI (`rust/cli`) — 30% → 100%

**Current State:** Clap-based CLI that parses `--prompt`, `--render-project`, `--format`, `--width/height/framerate` flags. The render path prints the ffmpeg command but doesn't actually render frames. Has an `unsafe { std::env::set_var }` call that's unnecessary and dangerous.

**What Must Be Done:**

| # | Task | Priority | Effort |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 5.1 | **Wire real frame rendering** — Replace the print-only `render_project` path with actual compositor frame generation piped to ffmpeg. | Critical | Large |
| 5.2 | **Remove unsafe set_var** — Line 43 uses `unsafe { std::env::set_var(...) }` which is UB in multi-threaded context. Use `std::env::set_var` (not unsafe) or pass config explicitly. | Critical | Small |
| 5.3 | **Implement progress reporting** — Add progress bars/status output during render. | High | Small |
| 5.4 | **Add all export format support** — Currently only MP4 config is wired. Add ProRes, DCP, AAF, MOV support via the export crate. | High | Medium |
| 5.5 | **Implement batch rendering** — Render multiple projects/versions from CLI args or a manifest file. | Medium | Medium |
| 5.6 | **Add integration tests** — Test actual CLI → compositor → ffmpeg → output file pipeline. | High | Medium |

---

### FORMAT 6: API Gateway (`rust/api-gateway`) — 45% → 100%

**Current State:** Axum server with 14 routes, JWT middleware, basic DB operations. But: uses SQLite in-memory (not PostgreSQL), has 3 hardcoded mock auth tokens, Stripe webhook doesn't verify signatures, uses hardcoded `"mock_user_id"`.

**What Must Be Done:**

| # | Task | Priority | Effort |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 6.1 | **Replace hardcoded auth tokens with real JWT** — Three literal tokens (`admin-token-123`, `editor-token-456`, `viewer-token-789`) must be replaced with proper better-auth JWT HS256 validation. | Critical | Medium |
| 6.2 | **Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL** — `DbStore` uses in-memory SQLite as fallback. Must connect to Azure PostgreSQL / DATABASE_URL. | Critical | Medium |
| 6.3 | **Implement Stripe webhook verification** — `handle_stripe_webhook` only prints event type. Must verify Stripe signatures with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. | Critical | Medium |
| 6.4 | **Fix hardcoded user ID** — `handle_get_projects` uses literal `"mock_user_id"` instead of decoded JWT subject. | Critical | Small |
| 6.5 | **Add rate limiting middleware** — No rate limiter exists on any route. | High | Medium |
| 6.6 | **Add CSRF protection** — No CSRF tokens on state-changing endpoints. | High | Small |
| 6.7 | **Fix port conflict** — Port 8005 claimed by both api-gateway and analytics-service Dockerfile. | High | Small |
| 6.8 | **Add API documentation** — No OpenAPI/Swagger spec exists. | Medium | Medium |
| 6.9 | **Add integration tests** — Test actual request → auth → DB → response flows. | High | Medium |

---

### FORMAT 7: MCP Server (`rust/mcp-server`) — 65% → 100%

**Current State:** Functional JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio MCP protocol server with 3 tools (autonomous_edit, get_timeline_state, apply_crdt_operation). Dockerfile has port mismatch (exposes TCP 5173 but MCP is stdio-based).

**What Must Be Done:**

| # | Task | Priority | Effort |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 7.1 | **Fix Dockerfile** — Container exposes port 5173 but MCP communicates over stdio. Dockerfile build context assumes repo root but it's in a subdirectory. | High | Small |
| 7.2 | **Add more MCP tools** — Expand beyond 3 tools. Add: export_project, analyze_media, generate_proxies, search_assets, apply_effect, manage_tracks. | High | Medium |
| 7.3 | **Add MCP resources** — Expose project list, media library, effect presets as MCP resources (not just tools). | Medium | Medium |
| 7.4 | **Add MCP prompts** — Expose common editing workflows as MCP prompt templates. | Medium | Small |
| 7.5 | **Add authentication** — Current MCP server has no auth. Should accept API key or JWT via environment. | High | Small |
| 7.6 | **Add tests** — No test files for MCP server. Test JSON-RPC protocol compliance. | High | Medium |

---

### CROSS-CUTTING: Rust Core/Crates — ~55% → 100%

These underpin all 7 formats:

| # | Task | Priority | Effort |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| C1 | **Wire real compositor into CoreEngine** — `render_frame()` returns a hardcoded mock RGBA buffer. Must pipe actual `Compositor::render_frame_to_texture()`. | Critical | Large |
| C2 | **Implement real undo** — `undo()` in `nle_state.rs` pops the stack but never reverses the operation. | Critical | Medium |
| C3 | **Implement real P2P networking** — `p2p-sync` has zero networking dependencies, hardcoded IPs. Must integrate libp2p/mDNS for mesh discovery. | High | Huge |
| C4 | **Fix broken merge** — `temporal-versioning/src/lib.rs:148` uses `|_t| true` which matches the first track always instead of the correct one. | Critical | Small |
| C5 | **Implement SAM2 real inference** — `masks/src/sam2.rs` returns a mock solid circle. Need ONNX runtime with real SAM2 model. | High | Large |
| C6 | **Implement VST3 host** — `audio/src/vst.rs` is a stub. Need real VST3 SDK integration. | Medium | Large |
| C7 | **Implement ACES color pipeline** — `compositor/src/aces.rs` has mock matrices. Need real ACES transforms. | Medium | Medium |
| C8 | **Implement stereoscopic 3D** — `compositor/src/stereoscopic.rs` is mock. Need real stereo camera rendering. | Medium | Medium |
| C9 | **Implement optical flow** — `effects/src/optical_flow.rs` is mock. Need real optical flow for speed ramping and frame interpolation. | High | Large |
| C10 | **Implement WebCodecs integration** — `wasm/src/webcodecs.rs` is a scaffold. Need real browser WebCodecs API bridge for hardware decoding. | High | Medium |
| C11 | **Remove dead code** — `big_bang.rs`, `singularity.rs` (satirical dead modules not declared in lib.rs). | Low | Small |
| C12 | **Remove unused dependencies** — `async-trait` in core, `bridge` dep in time crate, `compositor`/`time` deps in plugin. | Low | Small |

---

### CROSS-CUTTING: Microservices — ~30% → 100%

| # | Task | Priority | Effort |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| M1 | **Implement real SAM2 rotoscoping** — 10/12 pre-processing endpoints are stubs. SAM2 only import-checks. | Critical | Large |
| M2 | **Implement real NeRF extraction** — Both pre-processing and generative-studio have NeRF endpoints that only `import torch`. | High | Huge |
| M3 | **Implement real Demucs stem separation** — Only import-checks torch. No actual inference. | High | Medium |
| M4 | **Implement real RealESRGAN upscaling** — Only import-checks. | Medium | Medium |
| M5 | **Fix `/overdub` bug** — References `req.text_to_speak` but field is `text`. Will crash at runtime. | Critical | Small |
| M6 | **Fix missing `segment-anything` dependency** — Imported in pre-processing but not in requirements.txt. | Critical | Small |
| M7 | **Implement real video composition in render-service** — Currently produces solid-color canvases. Must translate CRDT timelines into actual ffmpeg filtergraphs with real clip processing. | Critical | Large |
| M8 | **Implement real Kafka in analytics-service** — Entirely mock. No Kafka producer, no ClickHouse, no LTV calculation. | High | Large |
| M9 | **Implement real collab-server persistence** — Save/load endpoints are stubs. y-sync crate unused. No CRDT state storage. | High | Large |
| M10 | **Fix `GEN_STUDIO_URL` typo** — In ai-agents orchestrator, this undefined variable will cause runtime ReferenceError. | Critical | Small |
| M11 | **Fix Anthropic API routing** — ai-agents sends Anthropic-format requests to OpenAI endpoint. | Critical | Medium |
| M12 | **Break up Python monoliths** — Both Python services are single-file 400+ line monoliths. Need route/service/module separation. | Medium | Medium |
| M13 | **Fix port 8002 conflict** — Both ai-agents and collab-server claim port 8002. | High | Small |
| M14 | **Add WebSocket authentication** — Both sync implementations allow anonymous CRDT broadcast. | Critical | Medium |
| M15 | **Add shutdown handling** — render-service SIGTERM kills BullMQ worker mid-job. | High | Small |
| M16 | **Fix `/inpaint` endpoint** — Targets `api.runwayml.com/v1/inpaint` which doesn't exist as a public API. | High | Medium |

---

### CROSS-CUTTING: Infrastructure — ~80% → 100%

| # | Task | Priority | Effort |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| I1 | **Remove sensitive files from repo** — `env.yaml`, `web.json`, `db.json` contain real config data. `cloud-sql-proxy` binary removed. | Critical | Small |
| I2 | **Fix docker-compose env var gaps** — Stripe, Resend, Freesound, Marble vars missing from docker-compose.yml. | High | Small |
| I3 | **Consolidate CI/CD** — 4 overlapping systems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins). Keep GitHub Actions. | Medium | Medium |
| I4 | **Consolidate docker-compose files** — 7 files, many redundant. Reduce to 2 (main + dev). | Low | Small |
| I5 | **Standardize env var naming** — `RENDER_SERVICE_URL` vs `NEXT_PUBLIC_RENDER_SERVICE_URL` inconsistency. | Low | Small |
| I6 | **Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation** — No OTel in any service code despite having Tempo for tracing. | Medium | Large |
| I7 | **Configure Alertmanager receivers** — Slack/PagerDuty have placeholder keys. | Medium | Small |
| I8 | **Add end-to-end integration test** — Test full `ingest → transcribe → edit → render` pipeline across all services. | High | Large |
| I9 | **Build migration image in CI** — `Dockerfile.migrate` exists and is used by K8s init containers but not built by any CI pipeline. | Medium | Small |
| I10 | **Add API documentation** — No OpenAPI specs for any microservice. | Medium | Medium |

## Summary Table

| Area | Current | Target | Gap |
|------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Web App** | 75% | 100% | 25% |
| **Desktop App** | 1% | 100% | 99% |
| **Mobile App** | 15% | 100% | 85% |
| **Browser Extension** | 65% | 100% | 35% |
| **CLI** | 30% | 100% | 70% |
| **API Gateway** | 45% | 100% | 55% |
| **MCP Server** | 65% | 100% | 35% |
| **Rust Core/Crates** | 55% | 100% | 45% |
| **Microservices** | 30% | 100% | 70% |
| **Infrastructure** | 80% | 100% | 20% |
| **Overall Platform** | **~35%** | **100%** | **~65%** |

---

## Bottom Line

The platform is in **early alpha**. The architectural vision is solid and the Rust foundation (CRDT state, GPU compositor, effects shaders, time types, filter graph DSL) is genuinely impressive. But the surface area far exceeds the implementation depth. Roughly **60-65% of advertised functionality is stubbed or mocked**. The web app is the only format with real implementation. Getting to a completely working platform across all 7 formats would require approximately **9-14 months for a team of 4-6 engineers** working full-time.

---

## Key Strengths

1. **GPU compositor** (`rust/crates/compositor/`) — 1070-line, 17 blend modes, MSDF text, stereoscopic 3D — genuinely impressive
2. **K8s manifests** — Production-grade with NetworkPolicies, HPAs, PDBs, ExternalSecrets, CronJobs, GPU support
3. **Monitoring stack** — Full Grafana/Prometheus/Loki/Tempo/Alloy with pre-built dashboards and SLOs
4. **Azure Terraform** — Full Azure infrastructure with GPU node pool support
5. **CRDT foundation** — LWW-Register, vector clocks, tombstones, operation-based CRDTs — correct primitives
6. **CLAUDE.md** — Excellent developer documentation, comprehensive and accurate
7. **Web app scope** — 1000+ files covering editor, canvas, timeline, effects, masks, collaboration, storage migrations
8. **CI/CD thoroughness** — Rust fmt/clippy/test, WASM build, Python tests, Node tests, Docker builds, deploys
9. **Ansible provisioning** — Complete node setup from bare metal to K8s with GPU drivers
10. **Graceful degradation pattern** — Services fall back to local processing when API keys are absent
